# Specification - Command Autocomplete Protocol

Version: 0.1.0

## Overview

This document defines a Command Autocomplete Protocol. It is an RPC like
protocol between a client (e.g. shell) and a server (e.g. CLI providing the
completions).

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

The type definitions are currently defined using typescript.

To represent a lack of value, we always use lack of field in the object. No
field should ever be set to `null`. This is chosen as we will want to extend
objects over time with new fields, so all implementations should always handle
new, unknown fields in the object (unless explicitly stated that the object is
`closed` and will not have new fields).

TODO: consider if we should allow nulls and just treat them always the same way
as missing field.

TODO: find if there is a better way to define the protocol that does not depend
on typescript.

## Protocol

The protocol uses https://jsonlines.org - line separated, utf8 json objects.
Every object MUST be a valid `Message` (as defined below).

```typescript
export type Message = Request | Response;
```

```typescript
// Closed (will not have new fields)
interface Request {
  id: string;
  method: string;
  params: object;
}
```

```typescript
export type Response = ResponseOk | ResponseError; 

// Closed (will not have new fields)
interface ResponseOk {
  id: string;
  result: object;
}

// Closed (will not have new fields)
interface ResponseError {
  id: string;
  error: Error;
}

interface Error {
  code: string;
  message: string;
}
```

### Protocol errors

If the line in the communication protocol is `invalid`, the communication MUST
be closed.

The line is invalid if there is no way to properly respond to such message.
More concretely:

- the line is not a valid utf8
- the line is not a valid JSON object (unparsable)
- the line is not a valid Message
- the `Response.id` does not match any incoming `Request.id`
- the `Request.id` was already received in another request

The following are NOT considered invalid protocol lines:

- the `Request.method` is unknown (error MUST be returned with `INVALID_REQUEST` code)
- the `Request.params` does not match the method (error MUST be returned with `INVALID_REQUEST` code)
- the result contains unexpected result

## Messages

### Initialize

- Method: `initialize`
- Request Params: `InitializeParams`
- Response Result: `InitializeResult`

We are introducing this method, so that in the future we can extend the protocol
by adding new capabilities into the initialization.

```typescript
interface InitializeParams {
}

interface InitializeResult {
}
```

### Complete

- Method: `complete`
- Request Params: `CompleteParams`
- Response Result: `CompleteResult`

```typescript
interface CompleteParams {
  args: string[];
  working_dir: string,
  envs: EnvironmentVariable[]
}

interface CompleteResult {
  values: CompleteValue[];
}

interface CompleteValue {
  value: string;
  description?: string;
}

interface EnvironmentVariable {
  name: string,
  value: string,
}
```

### Shutdown

- Method: `shutdown`
- Request Params: `ShutdownParams`
- Response Result: `ShutdownResult`

```typescript
interface ShutdownParams { }
interface ShutdownResult { }
```
